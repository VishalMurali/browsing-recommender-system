# digitalocean-recommender-system
Building recommendations systems using collaborative filtering on customer web browsing data for Digital Ocean. In this project, use an item to item collaborative filtering approach to build a recommendation system. We are given the web session data, the web pages data and the tags for each page, and we have to use this data to come up with a recommendation system for a user.
